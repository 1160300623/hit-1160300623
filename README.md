It's an easy project which I finished in the process of learning the multi-threads.
There are some bridges where there are lots of monkey trying to get across the river. A monkey either moves from the left to the right or from the right to the left. If two monkeys with the different directions are on the same bridge, then both of them can't move on,i.e. this is a failure.
What I'm working on is to make sure every monkey can reach the opposite side of the river. Also, time consumption is taken into account.
